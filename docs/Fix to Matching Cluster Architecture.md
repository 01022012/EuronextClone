# FIX to Matching Engine Cluster Architecture

## Notes
* The following architecture diagram does not capture high availability and/or failover aspect of the overall design; only the main messaging flow is presented
* FIX server communicates with the clients over standard FIX protocol (clients not shown on the diagram)
* Each FIX server is responsoble for a configured subset of clients (brokers)
    * When orders come in over FIX from brokers they are published using multicast with the instrument name as the topic (routing key)
    * Each FIX server subscribes for execution updates related to its subset of brokers and relays them over FIX to the clients
* Each matching engine (ME) is responsible for its range of instruments (maybe configured statically or dynamically)
    * Each ME subscribes for order events related to its range of instruments on a multicast channel, published to by the FIX servers. Orders and other instructions are then routed (based on instrument) to their respective matching unit (MU) for execution/processing.
    * When trades and other events are generated by MU they are published by ME using multicast with the affected broker as the topic (routing key)
